# Quest Mod Template

A template for creating Beat Saber mods for the Oculus Quest. This template takes advantage of the VScode [Project Templates Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cantonios.project-templates) to handle the placeholders.

This template is set up for downloading dependencies using QPM. You can find more info about getting started with Quest modding [here](https://github.com/danrouse/beatsaber-quest-modding-guide).

**Fork from the original one that adds Mod settings and codegen so you don't have to set all up yourself**
